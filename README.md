### Initial Prototype
1. What have you done so far?  
We created a visualization that shows the difference in typing speed between people with and without parkinsons. We have an animation that plays and shows the difference in typing speed. We do this by showing the keys pressed and the words being typed out in real time along with a progress bar. The animation also has a stop button so that it can be reset or canceled anytime. There is a text box that allows users to enter their own phrases.

2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?  
The most challenging part of the project will be getting the animations to work dynamically. The dataset we are working with is large and thus slow and difficult so we have been hardcoding values in order to get the animations to work. We will need to find a way to efficiently get these values into the working visualization. We want to also implement more features to the visualization that allow for further customization such as a toggle for whether the patient is currently on parkinsons medication or not.
